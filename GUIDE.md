# Guide

## What's in here?

Everything that's explained on the [boilerplate homepage](http://meteor-boilerplate.surge.sh/) and

* Linting with eslint (`meteor npm run lint`)
* Full-Stack Testing (`meteor npm run test`)
* Continuous Integration with Travis

## Why this stack?

I've tried to use technologies that have been helpful these past few years for projects that I've worked on. 
Here are some links that explain or explore technologies and approaches that can be used with this boilerplate.

* [Rationalizing functional css](https://marcelosomers.com/writing/rationalizing-functional-css/) (with tachyons)
* [An open letter regarding semicolons](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding) (standardjs has no semicolons)
* [Meteor Testing Guide](https://guide.meteor.com/testing.html)
* [Mobile first](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933)

Regarding frontend libraries this boilerplate isn't very opinionated. This project uses blaze by default, but it's easy to
 change to other popular frontend libraries such as [React](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) or [Vue](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-meteor).

## Generating files

With [orion-cli](https://github.com/matteodem/orion-cli) you can scaffold files based on the configuration of the boilerplate.

```sh
orion generate component
```

You can create components, models etc. and reset the project with the console tool (see below).
